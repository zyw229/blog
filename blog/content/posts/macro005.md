# Summary

The Fed finally paused in the June FOMC meeting, despite revising upwards their economy projections and the dot plot. This weird combination signals there is something else on their mind, as the tightening seems to have hit a wall. In this article, we discuss what that wall maybe, how will the policy path evolve, and what are the implications to the economy and markets going forward.
