## Summary

In this article, we explore the various ways that bank stress mechanically influences overall market liquidity, and revisit the metrics we've been watching since the SVB failure. Through analyzing past few weeks data, we project that the liquidity situation does not look too promising for the next few weeks. Until next wave of regional banks failures, overall market liquidity will remain tight.

## Bank stress

77 days have passed since the SVB and Signature Bank failures. Since then, another major bank (First Republic) has failed. It was even more significant in a sense that, it was not considered to have the same deposit concentration problem as SVB did.

It's widely known that those banks failed due to their exposure to interest rate risk. Having bought in large amount of low-interest long-duration assets during the 2021-2022 Fed-induced fixed income bubble, banks suffered a large loss on their hold-to-maturity (HTM) portfolio.

> Note that almost all banks suffered a few percentage point capital ratio loss due to duration exposure. SVB was one of the more severely impacted banks. As this data was reported in Q4 2022, further rapid rise in interest rates in Feb 2023 likely pushed SVB into underwater territory.

The loss in their HTM portfolios has led to several bank failures, though in different forms. SVB was killed by a fast evolving bank run, as deposit panicked when they saw their bank going effectively underwater. First Republic, on the other hand, was on life support for a few more weeks until it eventually slow bled to death. This showed that those failures are not entirely driven by panic, but can instead be driven by totally rational choices by depositors in search of higher yields.

### Fed emergency bank lending facilities

Fed, working in conjunction with the Treasury and FDIC, has a few important tools to provide emergency liquidity for the banking system:

- **Discount Window** has been the primary lending facility before the SVB crisis, which is a standing facility that allows banks to borrow from the Fed at a penalty rate. This usage shows up in the Fed balance sheet under **"Primary credit"**;
- **Bank Term Funding Program** (BTFP) is a new facility that was introduced in the wake of the regional bank crisis. It allows banks to use long-term treasury & MBS to borrow from fed at a penalty rate, but in the amount of **par value** of those assets. This is intended to completely negate the impact of interest-rate loss on banks. This usage shows up in the Fed balance sheet under **"Bank Term Funding Program"**;
- **Loans to FDIC** happens when a bank is shut down and goes into FDIC receivership. Fed extend temporary loans to those banks to allow FDIC to pay out depositors, with guarantee that FDIC will eventually pay back these loans. This usage shows up in the Fed balance sheet under **"Other credit extensions"**.

As discussed in my [previous article](https://zyw229.github.io/posts/macro001/), the above-mentioned facilities directly contribute to overall market liquidity. An increase in usage of those facilities should have a marginal equivalent effect of QE, as it marginally pushes investors into riskier assets.

### How heavily are those facilities used?

Here, we look at the individual usage of these facilities since the start of March, around the time of SVB failure.

> The aggregate usage of BTFP, Discount window & FDIC loans over the last 12 weeks.

Let's interpret what the movements of the usage of these facilities implied:

* In the week of 3/15, as the banking crisis broke out, there is a large spike in FDIC loans as SVB & Signature banks went into FDIC receivership. There is also a large spike in Discount Window usage reflecting the overall stress in the regional bank sector;
* In the week of 3/22, total injected liquidity peaked. Since then, banks have been gradually shifting their Discount Window loans into BTFP, all the way until the week of 4/5;
* In the week of 5/3, First Republic Bank went into FDIC receivership. The Discount Window loans they were using were transferred to FDIC loans. Surprisingly, this event did not increase the overall liquidity;
* Since then until 5/24, there has been a steady increase in the usage of BTFP. However, that is not enough to offset FDIC loan repayment. And overall liquidity injection level has been steadily decreasing.

## Is the regional bank crisis over?

### Liquidity stasis

As indicated above, the usage of such facilities has been slightly decreasing ever since 3/22. As FDIC loans gets repaid, we should generally see the green bars above continue to shrink. Since these loans should be repaid fairly quickly, it is probable that overall usage of those facilities continue to decline.

On the other hand, as the inflation / soft-landing narrative takes center stage again, we are seeing treasury yield continue to climb back closer to its February level, causing more stress in the banking sector. This time, with BTFP, banks need not worry about the loss on their BTFP-qualifying assets' (e.g. Treasury and MBS) interest rate loss. Rather than more immediate bank failures, we're likely to see only moderate increase of BTFP usage in the coming weeks, partially offsetting the liquidity shrink caused by FDIC loan repayment.

> Since April, the usage of BTFP is somewhat correlated with 10-year yield, which is a good measure of financial condition tightness. As 10-year yield getting closer to its February levels, BTFP usage should continue to increase in the coming weeks.

As the continued repayment of FDIC loans and the BTFP usage increase continue to offset each other, there should be no major liquidity event ahead. As QT continues, we are likely entering at best a period of liquidity stasis, or worse, a period of liquidity drain for the coming 2-3 months.

### Bank walk & controlled demolition

However, banks have other loans that are not BTFP-eligible, like commercial real estate loans. If anything, those are the loans that will likely kill the next batch of trouble banks, unless a significant shift in monetary policy comes before more stress.

Unluckily, regional banks have a particularly high exposure of such types of assets. As treasury yield slowly climb back and financial conditions tighten again, such loans' losses will be scrutinized again.

After the initial SVB shock that caught banks off guard, most banks now have significantly improved their asset allocation to be more resilient to future interest rate shocks. One notable example is the recent news of struggling bank PacWest [proactively offloading some portion of its bad loans](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/struggling-pacwest-offloads-real-estate-151928827.html). All regional banks, barring a few outliers, are well positioned to survive another few months.

Although bank can do whatever it needs to improve its asset allocation including raising capital, it cannot solve the fundamental problem that deposits are slowly leaving the system, due to much better alternative (even the RRP is at 5%) compared to the deposit rates those banks are currently offering.

First Republic has shown us a slow bank run can also cause a bank to fail. As this "bank walk" continues across the board, and with no massive monetary policy relief in sight, it's only a matter of time until more regional banks collapse under such pressure. After a relatively stable period since those three banks fail, in a few months time, we may finally see another wave of bank failures as this pressure builds up again. And this controlled demolition of regional banks goes on...

## What's next for regional banks?

In the short term, current relative stability in the regional banks are setting up for a period of liquidity statis / drain. This pressure will continue to build up until we see clear signals of massive monetary easing and real cracks in the economy. A soft-landing narrative will make such scenarios unlikely, and that could possibly lead to more bank failures later in the year.

With the Treasury replenishing the TGA in the second half of year, financial condition is likely to significantly worsen, causing asset prices to drop in the near term, and more bank stress. Until more bank fails, there is probably no liquidity relief in sight. Investors will have to get through the next few months and, ironically, pray for more banks to fail. Maybe if enough of them fail, the Fed will go back to buying stuff again :)
