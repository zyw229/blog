## Summary

In this article, we discuss the effect of the proposed bank rescue package and why it was risk-positive for the market, and why the debate on whether this is QE is pointless. The market should only care about the fact that this rescue package achieves similar results of a QE program.

One thing that caught the market's attention last week was the sudden spike in the Fed's balance sheet, effectively reversing the amount achieved by QT since last November:

There has been much debate about whether this signals the end of QT, and perhaps the beginning of the next round of QE. However, I think there is little point of debating whether this is 'QE' or not. By definition, this is definitely not QE; however, it is useful to think about how this will affect the fund flows.

Let's first consider the immediate effect of the runs on regional banks and the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) that started last week.

The BTFP assured the at-risk regional banks that they don't have to sell their low-risk assets. This backstopped the fire-sale of low-risk assets in prevention of future bank runs. However, presumably, a good number of depositors in medium-to-small regional banks took their money out. Assuming they don't immediate YOLO and buy stonks or crypto, they basically have three choices:

1. Buy Money Market Fund (MMF) and get some risk-free yield;
1. Invest in treasury, get some yield free of default risk;
1. Deposit their money into safer banks.

I'm uncertain what percentage of those money ended up in MMF or treasury directly, but it is not crazy to assume that most of money ended up in safer banks (option 3 above). This additional inflow **increases** the deposit base of large banks, further boosting their balance sheet, and some portion of it will end up in the treasury and MBS markets. (Note: option 2 also created additional inflow towards the treasury market.)

Looking at the net effects of such mechanism, BTFP backstopped high-risk banks from fire-selling their high quality assets; while low-risk banks saw an inflow of deposits that allowed them to purchase more high-quality assets like treasury bonds. This net effect possibly contributed to the aggressive upward move in the treasury market since the bank failures.

However, the effects of such move do not stop within the treasury market. The rapid decrease in short-term yield (2-yr yield dropping from above 5% to below 4% within a week) inevitably pushes investor out on the risk curve. T-bill holders may consider extending their duration, while more investor will consider buying tech stocks, gold, or even crypto, instead of T-bills considering the decreasing attractiveness of short-term yield.

That's the reason why I find it pointless deciding whether this is 'QE' or not. QE also had the effect of pushing investor out on the risk curve. Regardless of terminology, the effect of such implementation is risk-positive, equivalent to QE, and that's what the market should only care about, at least in the short term.
