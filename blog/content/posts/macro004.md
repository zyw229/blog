# Summary

Now that the US debt ceiling is resolved, market is faced with a large amount of new bill issuance in Q3 2023 to refill the TGA. Whether this new issuance is funded via RRP versus bank reserves makes a huge difference in market liquidity. This article speculates why the promised Fed "pause" in June is to help facilitate the TGA refill. It also discusses how the refill process is linked to the real economy data, and why "good news is good news" might be true again for the market going forward.

# Treasury General Account (TGA) refill

The political drama revolved around US debt ceiling has finally ended, but its real impact on the market has just started. The settlement means the US Treasury can finally issue more debt to fund its deficit. That itself is not news for the market. However, what market participants are concerned about is the rapid refill of the TGA, which will result in $550-600B of extra liquidity being absorbed from the system (to fund those Bond purchases).

## Marginal buyers

Such extra treasury bond issuance alone is not conclusive on the liquidity impact on the broader market, since it is unclear who will buy up those extra treasury offerings. There are two major sources of funding for this extra liquidity: **Bank reserves** or **Reverse Repo Facility (RRP)**. The question is: who will eventually end up buying those extra treasury bonds?

Whether the TGA refill will mainly be funded by retail / institutional investors via bank reserves; or by Money Market Funds (MMF) via RRP, will have huge implication on the liquidity path. If the RRP is the main source of funding, the impact of TGA refill will be mostly neutral; while a majority bank reserve funding scenario will be harmful for market liquidity.

A [recent post](https://fedguy.com/trapped-liquidity/) by FedGuy Joseph Wang analyzed the data and argued that extra Treasury bond purchases has recently been funded by bank reserves, rather than from RRP.

## Two sources of funding

To understand the basic mechanics, let's do some over-simplification: we assume there are only three destinations in the world an investor can deploy their cash:

* RRP: risk-free facility for qualified institutions to park their excess cash;
* T-bills: short term Treasuries, the thing the Treasury is offering to raise cash for refilling the TGA;
* AAPL (Apple stock): represents all assets riskier than cash-like instruments like RRP & T-bills.

The first two categories are what we consider as cash & cash-equivalents. When we hear that institutions are playing "defensive" and holding more cash, it usually means they were withdrawing from riskier assets and buying short-term Treasuries or park the money at RRP (normally via MMFs).

> Two sources of funding to refill the TGA: from RRP (blue) or from bank reserves (red).

Although not very accurate, this is conceptually how one can picture the basic mechanics of the TGA refill's impact on the broader market. If money in the RRP were to flow into TGA (blue), the TGA refill will be liquidity-neutral; if bank reserves were to flow into TGA, this would be money that was withdrawn from (or could have been invested in) all sections of the market (red), including riskier assets like long-term bonds or AAPL. If this happens, the TGA refill will be liquidity-negative.

In the end, this extra T-bill issuance should be absorbed by a combination of bank reserve & RRP funding. The more it is tilted towards RRP, the better outcome in terms of market liquidity it will be.

# Fed June "skip"

The Fed has repeatedly committed that they'll be data dependent going forward. So the recent strong employment data had the market pricing in a continued 25 basis point Fed Funds Rate (FFR) increase in June.

However, in recent communications, Fed Chair Powell seems to have strongly insisted pausing rate increases in June, and keeping the option on the table for a makeup increase in July, even in the face of strong economic data.

This left some people scratching their head: why skipping June and hint a July hike?

## Making RRP less attractive

MMFs, as regulated, can only invest in so-called "risk-free assets" such as RRP and T-bills.  Currently, the SEC limits the Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) of MMFs to 60 days. Recent data indicates the demand are very strong for MMFs, so it looks like there are enough people willing to buy up those extra T-bills.

> Money Market Funds have shown decent inflows, likely from retail and institution investors, since 2023.

However, there is a strong alternative presented to the MMFs: the RRP is offering 5.05% annualized rate. This rate is set to be 5 basis points higher than the current lower bound of FFR. With current 1-month to 6-month Treasury yield sitting between 5.25% - 5.50%, one may still argue that T-bills are still *marginally more attractive* than the RRP rate.

If Fed were to raise FFR again in June, it will set RRP rate to 5.30%, bringing it essentially to parity with short T-bills. Right now, Fed would definitely love to keep RRP rate at 5.05%, such that T-bills are still marginally more attractive than the RRP, and use this chance to induce more money out of the RRP.

# Good news is good news again

After months of "bad news is good news" contrived thinking, as the market fears bad economic data will lead to higher terminal rate, we are returning to a regime where "good news is good news" again, as the Fed seems to be unwilling to exacerbate the liquidity drain by further raising FFR.

Stronger economic data will attract more funds into the stock market, leading to higher bond yields, thus making room for RRP funds to flow out. On the contrary, weaker economic data will cause funds flowing out of stocks towards Treasury bonds, causing yield lower, further trapping money within RRP.

Right now, Fed has been successful in convincing the market they will do another rate hike in July. This cooperative attitude in the market is grounded in the belief that we'll have a strong economy and a soft-landing. The small bump (indicating an expectation in July hike) in risk-free yield in the 1 to 6-month section has provided at least some reason for RRP money to come out.

For this plan (to induce money out of RRP) to succeed, it is important for yield curve not to collapse, and new economic data to continue to deliver. In this market, good news will be good news again.

Strong economic data, such as good employment data, will be helpful to the market. Even a mildly strong **inflation data**, as long as it's not blowing off estimates, will help support asset prices. After all, a solid inflation rate at least indicates a solid consumption economy, to some extent.
